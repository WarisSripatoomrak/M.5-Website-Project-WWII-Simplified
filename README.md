# M.5-Website-Project-WWII-Simplified
We had to make a website about any topic using Adobe Dreamweaver. The project was at an enormous 80 points. I opted for a World War since it's chronological, so managing the contents is easy.

This project piqued my interest and enthusiasm for website design and development to new heights. I had ideas about inserting animations, videos, and even 3D models into it. But I have yet to gain more experience. I had a blast with this, from preparing the contents to finishing the last page.
